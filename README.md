Check Custom Banned Words Against Azure AD Banned Words Global &amp; Per-Tenant List
====================================================================================

            

WARNING: Due to retirement of Technet Script Gallery, migrated to:


[https://github.com/zjorz/Public-AAD-Scripts/blob/master/AAD-Password-Protection-Check-Custom-AAD-Banned-Word-List.ps1](https://github.com/zjorz/Public-AAD-Scripts/blob/master/AAD-Password-Protection-Check-Custom-AAD-Banned-Word-List.ps1)


 


With this PoSH script, you can test candidate banned words in a text file against Azure AD to determine if a word is already listed in either the global Microsoft list and/or the custom per-tenant list. As the custom per-tenant list has a current limit
 of 1000 you do not want to duplicate words

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
